As the new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my primary project involves managing employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. This task encompasses designing SQL tables to accommodate six CSV files, importing the data into a SQL database, and conducting thorough analysis to extract meaningful insights. By meticulously modeling the data structure, ensuring accurate data engineering practices during import, and performing detailed data analysis, I aim to uncover key trends and patterns in employee demographics, hiring practices, and departmental distributions during that period. This project not only enhances my skills in data management and analysis but also contributes valuable insights to Pewlett Hackard's historical workforce dynamics.
